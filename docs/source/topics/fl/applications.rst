In theory, federated learning sounds like a perfect plan that helps mitigate the major problems often faced when implementing traditional ML models with data residing in one central location. New to the landscape of artificial intelligence, federated learning is still being actively researched. But there already are a few examples of FL practical use.

Healthcare
-----------------------------------
Healthcare is one of those industries that can benefit from federated learning the most, considering that protected health information can’t be shared that easily due to HIPAA and other laws. In this way, masses of diverse data from different healthcare databases and devices can contribute to the development of AI models, while complying with regulations.

One of the real-life examples is the use of federated learning for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The scientists applied data from 20 sources across the globe to train an FL model while maintaining anonymity. The model was called EXAM (electronic medical record chest X-ray AI model) and was aimed at predicting the future oxygen requirements of patients with symptoms of COVID-19. The model was trained on inputs of vital signs, laboratory data, and chest X-rays.


Advertising
-----------------------------------
Personalization highly relies on each individual user data, that’s obvious. However, more and more people are concerned with how much of the data they would prefer not to share with anyone brings up instances like social media sites, eCommerce platforms, and other places. While depending on the personal data of users, advertising can take advantage of federated learning to stay afloat and keep calm people’s fears.

Facebook is now rebuilding how its ads work by placing more value on user privacy. The company explores on-device learning by running algorithms locally on phones to find out what ads a user finds interesting. The results are then sent back to the cloud server in an aggregated and encrypted format for marketing teams to review.


Autonomous vehicles
-----------------------------------
Since federated learning is capable of providing real-time predictions, the approach is used in developing autonomous cars. The information may include real-time updates on the roads and traffic conditions, enabling continuous learning and faster decision-making. This can provide a better and safer self-driving car experience. The automotive industry is a promising domain for implementing machine learning in a federated manner. However, at the moment, there is only research being done in this direction. One of the research projects has proved that federated learning can reduce training time in wheel steering angle prediction in self-driving vehicles.
