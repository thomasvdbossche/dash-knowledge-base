Federated Learning
===================================

Federated learning is a machine learning technique that enables multiple devices or computers to learn a shared model while keeping their data local. It is useful in situations where data is distributed across multiple devices or locations and cannot be easily centralized.

In federated learning, the model is trained on a central server, but the training data remains on the individual devices or computers. The devices or computers send their updates to the model to the central server, and the server aggregates these updates to improve the global model. This process is repeated until the model converges.

One benefit of federated learning is that it allows for privacy-preserving machine learning, as the data never leaves the devices or computers on which it is collected. It also allows for more efficient and scalable machine learning, as the devices or computers can perform the training in parallel, reducing the time it takes to train the model.

Federated learning has applications in a variety of fields, including healthcare, finance, and Internet of Things (IoT).
